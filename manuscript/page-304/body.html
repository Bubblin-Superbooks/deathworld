Like all lifeboat controls these were childishly simple, designed to be used by novices in an emergency.

Jason didn't know who was flying it or what they had in mindâ€”he took no chances. Jamming the wheel forward into a dive he cursed as they eased into a gentle drop. The larger ship had no such restrictions. It changed course with a violent maneuver and dived on him. The forward turret fired and an explosion at the stern rocked the little boat.
