<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>A retired wrestler.</em> That was Jason's first thought. Kerk Pyrrus was a gray-haired rock of a man. His body seemingly chiseled out of flat slabs of muscle. Then Jason saw the gun strapped to the inside of the other man's forearm, and he let his fingers drop casually behind the pillow.</p><p>"I'd appreciate it," Jason said, "if you'd take off your gun while you're in here." The other man stopped and scowled down at the gun as if he was seeing it for the first time.</p><p>"No, I never take it off." He seemed mildly annoyed by the suggestion.</p><p>Jason had his fingers on his own gun when he said, "I'm afraid I'll have to insist. I always feel a little uncomfortable around people who wear guns." He kept talking to distract attention while he pulled out his gun. Fast and smooth.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He could have been moving in slow motion for all</p></div> </div>
